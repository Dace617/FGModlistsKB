## First Steps.

Remove LORA.
Install OWL Main File, you don't need any patches for any mods at all.
Randomized Special Loot is optional, but should work well and would give us a similar deal to LS3 where it's still possible to get higher tier gear at a lower player level. 




Add the two OWL patchers
SynOpenWorldLoot by Xanza, recommend putting it in it's own group to make it's own plugin
Also OWL-Leveled-List-Additions by TheOneAndOnlyJ3w3ls. 

DO NOT RUN THEM YET.

## Second Steps.

Make a new profile with *ONLY* the mods from the screenshot enabled. **This is important, if you run the OWL patcher on the entire load order you'll get items from quest mods and other extremely broken OP weapons distributed through every leveled list.**

Screenshot of the mods included.

When you have that Run J3w3ls patcher on this profile, this will add all the modded weapons to OWL's existing leveled lists.

## Third Steps.
Add the synth patch to the main profile, then run Xanza's SynOpenWorldLoot patcher, this will add OWL's leveled lists to every container, npc etc. that contains a record for a base game item, which combined with J3w3l's patcher now means we have modded items distributed through all of them as well.

I've made two consistency patches for the leveled lists to add back in other modded stuff like house keys etc, but still keep OWL's leveled list changes, I'll put them on a click up card and link it [here](https://app.clickup.com/t/860rcm972)

That should be it? I've briefly tested it by running around to various merchants and looted a handful of dungeons, and it seems fine?
Let me know if anything is off and I'll take a look. I did a lot of this quite a while ago and working off memory isn't my strong suite.
